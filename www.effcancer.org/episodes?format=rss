But that isn’t stopping him from starting a kickass podcast. Eff Cancer is a collection of dialogues with people navigating serious illness from every direction. Episodes feature deep, direct conversations with Tom’s family, other cancer patients, nurses and doctors who work with serious illness, and the people trying to advance and improve healthcare.</p>
<p>This show explores life, death, helping people, dealing with fear, coping with loss, and more. But these won't be downer discussions. They’ll be filled with laughter as well as honest explorations about what it means to live with serious illness. In Tom’s case that's almost always with humor. </p>
<p>None of us know when our final moment will come. So in the meantime, let’s focus instead on the beauty of now. </p>
<p>Eff Cancer. But embrace life. And, as we sign off every episode: </p>
<p>“Remember I love you.” (RILY)</p>]]></description><item><title>An ending, an interlude</title><category>Health</category><dc:creator>Chloe Riley</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 17:59:00 +0000</pubDate><link>https://www.effcancer.org/episodes/an-ending-an-interlude</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5fb30dffb6578673754bf5de:5fb30f20fe81d959f1ac0c87:5fb30f20fe81d959f1ac0c8a</guid><description><![CDATA[<p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A year ago today on July 3, 2020, Tom Riley — friend, father, husband, brother, son, cousin — was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

In a time like this, words can feel thin, not enough somehow. So instead of a lot of words, this episode contains just a few in the way of a short poem.  

When we first started this podcast, Tom sent this message:

“My only goal is to share my story and perspective, and to capture other people’s stories in a way that could be helpful to others. That’s my motivation.

This is my third act. I want it to be meaningful. And I want it to be fun.”

It was Tom, it was. And it will be. Thank you.

One foot in, one foot out. 

It’s also a grey place. We know what came before, but we can’t see what’s coming ahead. The narrative is fuzzy. In a place like this, really all you can do is sit with yourself. And trust. 

For Tom, the middle place came unexpectedly, in the form of receiving an extra week between chemo treatments. It was the gift of extra time. But it was time that felt like both a blessing and a curse. For what’s the good of time, if you’re unsure how to spend it? If you can feel it slipping away even as you try harder and harder to hold on.  

And then, just as suddenly as it came, it was gone. And now, a new, very unexpected feeling.The feeling of looking backwards at the middle place.
